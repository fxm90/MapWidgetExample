**Note:** As a `UIViewRepresentable` is not supported in widgets, Apple's recommendation for displaying maps inside widgets is to use a [`MKMapSnapshotter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapsnapshotter).

üîê ‚Äì To receive the current user-location you have to add the following lines to the `Info.plist` of your application.
