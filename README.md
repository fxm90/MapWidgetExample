**Note:** As a `UIViewRepresentable` is not supported in widgets, Apple's recommendation for displaying maps inside widgets is to use a [`MKMapSnapshotter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapsnapshotter).

## How to use
üì≤ Clone the repository and run `pod install` in the terminal to install the dependencies. Afterwards run the application and add the `MapWidgetExample` to your home screen.

## Privacy related code
üîê To receive the current user-location you have to add the following lines to the `Info.plist` of your application.

```
Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description
Privacy - Location Usage Description
```

Furthermore you have to add these three lines to the `Info.plist` of your widget extension as well.

```
Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description
Privacy - Location Usage Description
Widget Wants Location
```

This is already done in this example application.
